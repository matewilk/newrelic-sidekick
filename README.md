# New Relic Sidekick

 Sidekick is a tool written in Node.js for processing `.side` files. It is designed to work with Selenium IDE projects, allowing you to filter and export your test suites into New Relic Scripted Browser compatible files.

 ## NPM

You can find this package on npm: [newrelic-sidekick](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newrelic-sidekick)


 ## Installation

 You can install Sidekick globally using npm:

 ```bash
 npm install -g newrelic-sidekick
 ```

 ## Usage

 To use Sidekick, you need to provide an input `.side` file and an output directory:

 ```bash
 sidekick <input.side> <output_directory>
 ```

 For example:

 ```bash
 sidekick myProject.side ./output
 ```

 This will process the `myProject.side` file and output the results to the `./output` directory.

## Automated Test Step Types Guide
## Introduction
This guide details the automated test step types generated by `SideKick`. The steps are automatically generated and can be amended only in the output script itself ( `*.js` file). It's important to understand the behavior of each step type to make appropriate adjustments in the script for accurate test execution and results.
By default all steps are generated as `HARD` steps. The step type can be changed by using the `stepLogger` function. The function accepts the following parameters:
- `stepType` - the type of the step. See below for the list of available step types.
- `stepName` - the name of the step. This is the name that will be displayed in the script's log output.
- `journeyName` - the name of the journey. This is the name that will be displayed in the script's log output.
- `stepFunction` - the function that implements the step. This is the function that will be executed when the step is executed.

Those parameters are generated automatically by `SideKick` and can be adjusted in the output script.

### `HARD` Steps
- **Definition**: Critical steps whose failure stops the test journey.
- **Behavior**: Execution halts on failure.
- **Use Case**: Essential functionalities.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  await stepLogger(
    STEP_TYPE.HARD, // step type
    "Open URL", // step name
    "Journey", // journey name
    async () => { /* step implementation */ }
  );
  ```
### `SOFT` Steps
- **Definition**: Important but not critical steps. Test continues on failure, but it's recorded.
- **Behavior**: Test journey continues; failure marks journey as failed.
- **Use Case**: Important but non-critical functionalities.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  await stepLogger(
    STEP_TYPE.SOFT, // step type
    // ... other parameters
  );
  ```
### `OPTIONAL` Steps
- **Definition**: Steps that do not impact the test outcome.
- **Behavior**: Failure is noted but doesn't affect overall success.
- **Use Case**: Non-essential features.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  await stepLogger(
    STEP_TYPE.OPTIONAL, // step type
    // ... other parameters
  );
  ```
